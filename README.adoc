= User Service

Service responsible for managing users and login.

== Tech-Stack
The project service is based on the Spring Framework with Webflux and Netty as its HTTP-server stack and ActiveMQ connections as message broker. The project service is connected to dedicated PostgreSQL database, where data is persisted.

== Database / PostgreSQL
The database holds all information of projects, its members - users associated with a project, and existing user ids for data integrity.

== Message-Broker / ActiveMQ
The project service is listening to two ActiveMQ topics:

=== microservices.dataEvents
This service is interested in creation and deletion events for users within the system to update its local table with user ids.
All other events are ignored.

=== microservices.sagaEvents
This service is interested in ProjectDeleteSagaEvents containing results of other services involved in saga transactions orchestrated by this service.

== Saga
This service is the choreographer for a project deletion saga. Whenever it is requested to delete a project, it saves the data to be deleted and sends an event via "microservices.sagaEvents" - Topic. It subsequently awaits messages marking further steps ("chapters") within the saga.

This service uses the https://git.thm.de/microservicesss21/service-lib/-/blob/master/README.md[service-lib] as a dependency.
